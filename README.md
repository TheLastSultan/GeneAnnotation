## Features
### Find Shine-Delgarno, -10 Promotor Region, and -35 Promtor Regions
Given an optimal start and stop codon find shine-delgarno sequence, -10 promotor region and -35 promotor region. What's more is that for any organism you can adjust the paramater in the script for start codons, stop codons, the -10 region, and the -35 region.

### Find Optimal ORF for a given coding region
Algorithim will comb thorugh each ORF reading frame possibility and set the ORF that is the best match with the promotor regions.

### Find Rho Dependent and Rho Independent Terminator 
Algorithim will comb thorugh each terminator possibility and assign a Rho Independent Terminator if a region is AT rich or a Rho Independent region of a region is AC Poor

### Extract MRNA Pin-Structures for any given Script
User profiles are public yet limited to functionality. Once logged in, profile editing and CRUD options are available. Clicking an image will open a modal which displays the photo, caption & location, and comments and likes. The layout utilizes CSS3 for responsiveness.
